### Questions & Answers

#### Tell me about yourself

I’m a software architect with around 11 years of experience, primarily working on building and evolving large-scale products. In my current role, I focus on system design, improving reliability, and enabling teams through better processes and mentoring.

Over the years, I’ve worked on complex initiatives like migrating monolithic systems to microservices, introducing micro-release strategies for long-cycle desktop products, and resolving deeply rooted system issues such as long-broken automated tests. I’ve also grown into leadership roles where I learned that enabling the team and improving collaboration often has more impact than individual execution.

I’m known for being structured in my thinking, calm under pressure, and collaborative. I enjoy working in ambiguous situations, breaking down complex problems, and helping teams move faster without compromising quality.

At this stage in my career, I’m looking to work on problems at larger scale, with strong engineering culture and high impact—which is why I’m excited about opportunities at Google.

#### Why Google?

I’m passionate about building dependable, scalable systems that serve millions of users and solving high-complexity problems with long-term impact. Over the past 11 years, I’ve focused on large product migrations, architectural improvements, and enabling team velocity — work that requires balancing quality, usability, and collaboration.

What draws me to Google is the scale, the engineering culture, and the way teams embrace ambiguity and technical excellence together. I’ve followed advancements like Titan M security enhancements, AI-driven developer tools, and ongoing research in reliability and fairness — all of which reflect an environment where engineering isn’t just about shipping features, but about improving how software works for billions of users.

I see a strong alignment between how I approach engineering — data-driven decisions, user-centered design, and cross-team collaboration — and how Google teams operate. I’m especially excited about opportunities to work on impactful systems where both technical depth and cross-functional communication matter.

After more than a decade in roles where I’ve led both technical and team outcomes, I feel ready for a space where the problems are larger, the scale is broader, and the learning is continuous — and Google uniquely fits that.


#### 1. Tell me about a time you had to work with someone whose working style was very different from yours. How did you handle it?


I once worked with a teammate whose working style was different from mine. I prefer to finalize the approach upfront by creating a high-level design, diagrams, and sometimes pseudocode to validate feasibility before implementation. My teammate preferred to move quickly into implementation, discuss things verbally at a high level, and refine the solution as challenges came up.

Initially, this caused some misalignment around expectations. To address it, I scheduled regular sync-ups to review his approach and progress. During a one-on-one discussion, I realized he wasn’t very comfortable creating diagrams because he wasn’t familiar with the tool I usually use.

To help, I started drawing diagrams in front of him, showing how simple and effective it could be. Gradually, he became more confident and interested in using the tool himself.

Together, we also agreed on a hybrid approach—spend a small amount of time upfront on lightweight design and alignment, then allow flexibility during implementation. This helped us combine speed with structure, improved code quality, and strengthened our collaboration.


#### 2. Tell me about a time you received critical feedback. How did you respond, and what did you do differently afterward?


In a previous role, I joined as a Tech Lead. During a one-on-one after about a year, my manager gave me critical feedback.
He told me that while I was performing very well as a senior developer, I wasn’t fully meeting expectations as a Tech Lead because I was trying to do too much myself instead of delegating.
Initially, it was difficult to hear, but I took it seriously and reflected on it. I realized I was optimizing for personal productivity rather than team effectiveness.
I consciously shifted my approach—started mentoring junior engineers, delegated technical tasks, and focused more on enabling the team.
Within a few weeks, team velocity improved, collaboration increased, and people became more proactive and comfortable sharing ideas.
This experience taught me that leadership is less about doing the most work and more about helping the team succeed.


#### 3. Tell me about a time you disagreed with a decision made by your team or manager. What did you do?


In a previous role, we were migrating from a monolith to microservices and needed a workflow tracking tool. Since we were part of an R&D team, we were limited to open-source options.

During discussions, most of the tools we evaluated were either too complex or didn’t align well with our actual needs. I suggested that we consider building a lightweight internal solution, but the team was concerned about maintenance cost and reinventing the wheel.

Rather than pushing the idea, one teammate and I proposed doing a small proof of concept in parallel, with a clear time box, to validate whether it was even viable.

We built a simple prototype in a few days and presented it to the team for feedback. Seeing that it addressed our core needs with a much lower learning curve, the team aligned on moving forward with it.

We then completed it collaboratively, and it was well adopted across the team. This experience reinforced for me the importance of respecting differing opinions while using data and prototypes to resolve disagreements constructively.


#### 4. Tell me about a time you had to help a teammate who was struggling. What did you do?


A few months ago, I noticed that several system tests hadn’t been running for almost two years. I discovered this while working on a feature.

I initially asked a teammate to investigate and fix it so they could own the solution. After a couple of days, they were still stuck, so I offered to help and we paired on it.

I first asked them to clearly explain the problem, what they had already tried, and what their current hypothesis was. This helped structure the debugging process and made sure we weren’t revisiting the same paths.

Together, we narrowed down the possibilities and eventually realized the issue wasn’t the code itself but that the runtime environment wasn’t picking up the latest changes. Once we identified and fixed that, the tests started running correctly.

More importantly, the teammate told me the structured way of debugging and questioning was helpful, and they later applied the same approach independently on other issues.


#### 5. How do you ensure that the work you do is inclusive and that different perspectives are considered?


Inclusiveness is something I try to practice intentionally in day-to-day work, both in technical and non-technical situations.

For example, a new team member joined our team, and a few months later we were preparing for a product showcase for a broad audience. During preparation, they were excited about explaining a deep technical aspect of the system.

I shared my perspective that, given the audience and the goal of the event, we might want to keep the discussion more high-level. Although we aligned on that initially, during the presentation they brought it up and received some follow-up questions they weren’t prepared for.

I stepped in to support them during the discussion so they wouldn’t feel exposed, and we handled it smoothly. Afterward, we had a constructive conversation about aligning content with audience and scope, and it became a good learning moment rather than a negative experience.

More generally, in team settings like backlog refinement, I make sure everyone has a voice. When perspectives differ, we rely on data, past experience, business goals, and user impact to make decisions.


#### 6. Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult trade-off between quality and speed on a project. How did you handle it?

In my last product development project, I worked on a POC for a new feature in a desktop software product that had a 6-month release cycle, with end-user availability taking over a year. The POC received strong positive feedback from marketing and stakeholders.

Integrating the feature into the product was complex, and the next code freeze was only 3–4 months away. I faced a trade-off: either rush full integration and risk quality, or delay the feature to the next release.

I analyzed the work needed and proposed a micro-release approach: deliver a minimal viable version of the feature to a subset of users. I carefully planned the MVP, ensured critical test coverage to avoid breaking existing functionality, and presented the plan to the PO. He supported it, discussed it with upper management, and we got approval.

The MVP was successful, received excellent feedback from the users, and in the next release we delivered the full feature. This experience reinforced the importance of balancing speed and quality while managing stakeholder expectations.

#### 7. Tell me about a time you noticed a process or system wasn’t working efficiently. How did you identify it and improve it?

In my current team, I observed that PR reviews were taking longer than expected, and sometimes discussions in comments led to unnecessary back-and-forth. To address this, I started setting up quick calls during PR reviews to clarify doubts in real-time. This not only sped up the process but also reduced misunderstandings.

Over time, the team began adopting this practice, exchanging perspectives and sharing knowledge during PR reviews, which improved team learning and collaboration.

Additionally, I encouraged a pairing room culture, where engineers collaborate more closely while coding. This further enhanced knowledge sharing and strengthened team cohesion.

As a result, PR turnaround times improved, and the team environment became more collaborative and productive.

#### 8. Describe a time when you solved a customer pain point.

I worked on a mobile app that allowed users to configure hearing aid devices via Bluetooth. One long-standing customer pain point was that whenever users made certain configuration changes, they had to re-pair the hearing aid for the changes to take effect. This was frustrating, especially given the accessibility context of the product.

I picked up this issue because it directly impacted the user experience and had been reported multiple times. The problem was difficult to reproduce and involved multiple teams across the mobile app and device firmware.

I coordinated with the relevant teams, added detailed logging, and performed deep analysis to understand the full workflow. After thorough investigation, I identified a race condition caused by a thread lock that was occurring intermittently.

Once fixed, users could apply changes without re-pairing the device, which significantly improved usability and reduced customer complaints. This experience reinforced for me the importance of prioritizing user pain points and collaborating across teams to resolve complex issues.



#### 9. What is the biggest hurdle you have faced in life? Why was it significant, and how did it affect you?

One of the biggest hurdles I faced was transitioning from being a strong individual contributor to taking on a leadership role.

Early in my career, my sense of value came from solving hard problems myself. When I moved into a Tech Lead role, that mindset became a limitation. I struggled with delegation and initially felt responsible for doing everything on my own.

This was significant because it affected not just my growth, but also the team’s effectiveness. Receiving direct feedback helped me realize that leadership isn’t about personal output, but about enabling others to succeed.

I worked intentionally to change my approach—mentoring juniors, delegating work, and focusing on collaboration. Over time, this made me a better leader and a more balanced engineer. It also shaped how I approach teamwork today, with more empathy and trust.

#### 10. Why are you leaving your current organization?

- I’m not leaving because of a negative experience. I’ve learned a lot in my current organization and I respect the people I work with.

Over time, I’ve realized that I’m looking for a role with larger technical scale, stronger engineering culture, and opportunities to learn from diverse teams working on complex problems.

I feel I’ve reached a point where my growth has plateaued in my current role, and I’m looking for an environment that challenges me further and allows me to have broader impact.

That’s what attracted me to Google.

- In my current role, the scope and challenges have been relatively stable for some time. While I’m grateful for the experience, I’m motivated by solving problems at scale and learning from strong engineering peers.

I see Google as a place where I can continue to grow technically and contribute to impactful products.

#### 11. Have you encountered unreasonable tasks from your manager? How did you handle them?

Yes, I have encountered situations where the initial ask felt unreasonable given the constraints.

In one case, we were asked to deliver multiple customer-facing features along with a significant refactor within a very short timeline. Based on past velocity and risk, I felt the scope was optimistic and could compromise quality.

Instead of pushing back emotionally, I broke the work into must-have versus nice-to-have items and gathered data around effort, dependencies, and risk. I shared this with my manager and proposed a couple of alternatives—either reducing scope or delivering part of the work incrementally.

After discussing the trade-offs, we agreed on a reduced scope with a phased delivery plan. We met the deadline without production issues, and the remaining work was completed in the following sprint.

This experience reinforced for me that what initially seems unreasonable often comes from different constraints, and my role is to make risks visible and work toward a shared solution.

#### 12. Describe a time when you had to make last-minute changes to your code. How did you feel about it?

Yes, I’ve had situations where last-minute changes were required. One example was close to a release when a late integration issue surfaced during final validation. The change impacted a customer-facing workflow, so delaying the release would have had broader implications.

Initially, there was some pressure because the code was already stabilized, but I focused on understanding the risk rather than reacting emotionally. I assessed the scope of the change, added targeted test coverage, and coordinated closely with QA and the dependent teams.

We implemented a minimal, well-scoped fix and validated it thoroughly before release. The change went out successfully without regressions.

While last-minute changes aren’t ideal, this experience reinforced for me the importance of staying calm, being pragmatic, and prioritizing customer impact over personal discomfort.

#### 13. How do you stay updated with the latest industry trends? Can you give an example of applying a new trend or technology in your work?

I stay updated through a mix of continuous learning and practical experimentation. I regularly follow engineering blogs, design docs, and tech talks, and I also learn a lot through discussions with peers and reviewing production systems.

One example was when we were migrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices. I spent time learning about service boundaries, API contracts, and observability patterns from industry best practices. Based on that, I proposed introducing lightweight workflow tracking and better logging and metrics early in the migration.

We applied these practices incrementally, which helped us identify failures faster and improve system reliability. This experience reinforced my belief that staying current is most valuable when new ideas are applied thoughtfully rather than adopted blindly.

#### 14. What would you do if you were going to miss a project deadline?

If I believe I’m going to miss a deadline, the first thing I do is assess the situation early and understand why—whether it’s scope creep, dependencies, or unexpected complexity.

I communicate proactively with my manager and stakeholders, sharing data around progress, risks, and impact. Rather than just flagging the problem, I come prepared with options—such as reducing scope, prioritizing must-have features, or proposing a phased delivery.

I also work with the team to see if we can remove blockers or adjust priorities without compromising quality. If the deadline still needs to move, I take ownership of that recommendation and help realign expectations.

For me, transparency and protecting user trust are more important than meeting a date at all costs.

#### 15. Suppose you are a product manager. After receiving all necessary approvals, a friend suggests a helpful change to your project. What do you do?

I would first understand the suggestion objectively, independent of the fact that it came from a friend. If it genuinely improves user value, quality, or reduces risk, I would evaluate its impact on scope, timeline, and stakeholders.

If the change is low risk and clearly beneficial, I would bring it back through the appropriate channels, explain the rationale, and seek alignment with stakeholders rather than making a unilateral decision.

If the change is high impact or would jeopardize commitments, I would acknowledge the idea, explain the constraints, and consider it for a future iteration instead.

Throughout, I would be transparent about the source of the suggestion and ensure decisions are made based on merit, not personal relationships.

- I’d evaluate the idea on its merits, not the relationship. If it’s beneficial and low risk, I’d take it through proper channels for alignment. If not, I’d defer it for a future iteration. Transparency and process matter.

#### 16. Imagine working on a project with a strict deadline. How would you approach the situation?

When working on a project with a strict deadline, my first step is to break down the work and understand what is critical versus nice-to-have. I identify dependencies, potential blockers, and estimate realistic effort for each task.

I communicate proactively with the team and stakeholders to align expectations and ensure everyone understands priorities. If necessary, I propose a phased or incremental approach to deliver the highest-value functionality first, without compromising quality.

I also make sure to monitor progress daily, remove blockers for the team, and encourage collaboration—pairing or peer reviews—so work moves efficiently. Finally, I stay flexible and prepared to adjust the plan if unforeseen challenges arise.

This structured yet collaborative approach helps the team deliver on time while maintaining quality and minimizing stress.

- I break down the work, prioritize critical tasks, and align with stakeholders. I monitor progress, remove blockers, and encourage collaboration. If needed, I propose incremental delivery to ensure quality and meet the deadline.

    Q: What if a blocker arises that threatens the deadline?

    “I evaluate options—remove the blocker, re-prioritize tasks, or negotiate scope—and communicate trade-offs to stakeholders so decisions are data-driven.”

#### 17. How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure at work?

I handle tight deadlines and pressure by staying structured and focused. First, I break down the work into critical and non-critical tasks and prioritize based on impact and dependencies. I make sure to communicate clearly with my team and stakeholders so expectations are aligned.

I encourage collaboration—pairing, code reviews, or quick sync-ups—so blockers are removed quickly and knowledge is shared. I also monitor progress daily and adjust the plan if needed.

Personally, I stay calm by focusing on what I can control and avoiding stress about things outside my influence. This approach helps me deliver high-quality results on time while keeping the team motivated and engaged.

- I stay structured, prioritize tasks, and communicate clearly with stakeholders. I encourage collaboration to remove blockers, monitor progress, and adjust as needed. Focusing on controllable actions helps me stay calm and deliver under pressure.

    Q: Have you ever missed a deadline despite these strategies?

    “Yes, and in those cases I immediately communicated, proposed trade-offs or phased delivery, and applied learnings to prevent recurrence.”

#### 18. Tell me about a time when your work was deprioritized mid-way through a project. How did you handle the situation?

In my last product development project, I was working on a POC for a new feature in our desktop software. Midway through, stakeholders decided that the main release would prioritize a different feature due to market needs, and my work was temporarily deprioritized.

Instead of getting frustrated, I reassessed the situation. I documented the current progress, identified reusable components, and communicated with my manager and team about how this work could be resumed quickly when priorities shifted back.

Meanwhile, I shifted focus to other critical tasks where I could add immediate value, including mentoring juniors and optimizing related workflows.

A few months later, when the feature became a priority again, we were able to pick it up quickly, integrate it efficiently, and release it successfully. This experience reinforced the importance of flexibility, communication, and making progress even when priorities change.

- Midway through a POC, stakeholders shifted priorities and my work was deprioritized. I documented progress, identified reusable components, and shifted focus to other high-value tasks. When the feature regained priority, we delivered it quickly and successfully.

#### 19. What would you do if your team was not bonding well?

If I noticed that my team wasn’t bonding well, I would first try to understand the root cause. Is it communication gaps, different work styles, or unclear goals? I would start by encouraging open dialogue through regular sync-ups, retrospectives, and one-on-one check-ins to understand individual perspectives.

I’d also introduce small collaborative practices—pair programming, joint design sessions, or team brainstorming—to foster interaction and shared ownership. For example, in my current team, I encouraged a “pairing room” culture where engineers could collaborate on tasks or PR reviews in real time. Over time, this improved knowledge sharing, reduced silos, and helped build trust among team members.

My focus would always be on creating an environment where everyone feels heard and valued, which naturally strengthens team bonding and productivity.

- I’d first understand the cause through one-on-ones and retrospectives, then introduce collaborative practices like pairing or joint design sessions. In my team, a pairing-room culture improved trust, knowledge sharing, and overall bonding.

- Q: What if some team members still resist bonding activities?

“I’d continue to respect their work style, ensure communication remains clear, and focus on shared goals. Over time, even small collaborative wins usually help build trust and engagement.”

#### 20. What would you do if a junior team member was not working properly and delaying tasks?

If a junior team member was not performing as expected and causing delays, I would first try to understand the root cause. Are they unclear about the requirements, struggling with the technology, or facing external blockers?

Once I identify the issue, I would provide guidance and support. For example, I would pair with them on tasks, explain concepts clearly, and help them break down work into manageable steps. I would also encourage them to ask questions early and provide regular feedback.

In my experience, this approach not only helps the individual improve but also benefits the team. The delays get reduced, collaboration improves, and the junior team member becomes more confident and proactive. I’ve seen this work effectively when mentoring new developers and enabling them to handle tasks independently over time.

- I’d first understand why the junior is struggling, then provide mentorship through pairing, clear guidance, and regular feedback. This helps them improve, reduces delays, and strengthens team collaboration.

#### 21. What challenges have you faced when mentoring junior colleagues?

When mentoring junior colleagues, one challenge I’ve faced is balancing guidance with autonomy. Early on, I noticed that some juniors were hesitant to make decisions or take ownership, often waiting for detailed instructions before proceeding. While my instinct was to step in and solve issues quickly, I realized this limited their learning.

To address this, I started pairing with them on tasks, asking them to explain their thought process and encouraging them to try solutions before stepping in. I also provided constructive feedback and helped them break down complex problems into manageable steps.

Another challenge was varying skill levels and learning speeds. I made sure to adapt my mentoring style—some needed hands-on walkthroughs, while others benefited from code reviews and discussions. Over time, these juniors became more confident, proactive, and capable of handling tasks independently, which improved overall team velocity and collaboration.

- One challenge when mentoring juniors was balancing guidance with autonomy, as some hesitated to take ownership. I used pairing, feedback, and adaptive mentoring to help them learn, which increased their confidence and improved team productivity.

#### 22. Tell me about a time when you had to work on multiple projects simultaneously.

In my previous role, I was simultaneously handling the migration of a monolith system to microservices and developing a POC for a new feature in the same product. Both projects had overlapping timelines and different priorities—one focused on system stability and the other on innovation.

To manage both effectively, I first prioritized tasks based on business impact and deadlines. I broke down each project into smaller milestones, allocated time blocks, and tracked progress regularly. I also leveraged delegation by mentoring juniors and distributing work wherever possible.

Communication was key—I set up weekly sync-ups with both teams to ensure transparency and align expectations. Whenever conflicts arose, I proactively discussed trade-offs with stakeholders and made data-driven decisions on what to focus on first.

As a result, we successfully completed the POC within the planned timeframe while keeping the migration project on track. This experience reinforced the importance of structured planning, effective delegation, and clear communication when managing multiple priorities.

- I managed a system migration and a POC simultaneously by prioritizing tasks based on impact, breaking work into milestones, delegating effectively, and maintaining clear communication with stakeholders. Both projects were completed successfully on time.

#### 23. Explain a situation where you misunderstood project requirements. How did you rectify it, and what did you learn?

In a previous project, I was working on integrating a new feature into our desktop product. Early in development, I misunderstood a requirement about how the feature should behave for a subset of users. I realized this only after a partial implementation and internal review.

To rectify it, I first paused further development and reviewed the requirements carefully with the PO and stakeholders. I clarified ambiguous points and documented them for the team. Then, I adjusted the design and implementation, coordinated with the QA team to update test cases, and communicated the revised plan to ensure everyone was aligned.

The feature was delivered successfully, and the experience taught me the importance of clarifying requirements early, asking questions when unsure, and maintaining open communication. Since then, I always do an initial requirement walkthrough with the team and document edge cases to avoid similar misunderstandings.

- I misunderstood a feature requirement early in development. I clarified it with stakeholders, updated the design, coordinated with QA, and communicated the plan to the team. The feature was delivered successfully, and I learned to clarify requirements early and document edge cases.

#### 24. How would you handle people who disagree with the majority decision on a non-work-related matter?

In non-work-related matters, I try to create an environment where everyone feels heard and respected. If someone disagrees with the majority, I first listen to their perspective to understand their reasoning and concerns. Often, this helps uncover nuances that others may not have considered.

I encourage open discussion without trying to immediately convince them to change their mind. If the disagreement doesn’t impact work outcomes or deadlines, I respect their choice while ensuring it doesn’t create friction within the group. Sometimes, I try to find a compromise or alternative solution that accommodates both sides.

For example, in a team outing, we once had a disagreement about the venue. Instead of enforcing the majority decision, we discussed everyone’s preferences, and eventually we chose a location that incorporated elements from both options. This approach kept the team spirit positive, inclusive, and collaborative.

- I listen to differing opinions, encourage open discussion, and try to find compromises if possible. If it’s a non-critical matter, I respect the choice while maintaining team harmony. This approach fosters inclusion and collaboration.

#### 25. How would you prioritize tasks when facing multiple critical deadlines?

When facing multiple critical deadlines, I prioritize tasks based on business impact, urgency, and dependencies. I break down each task into smaller milestones and estimate the effort required.

I communicate with stakeholders early to clarify priorities and negotiate timelines if needed. I also leverage delegation when possible, assigning tasks to team members based on their strengths.

For example, in a previous project, I was simultaneously handling a system migration and a POC for a new feature. I created a clear timeline, set milestones, and coordinated with the team. By focusing on high-impact tasks first and ensuring constant communication, we delivered the POC on time while keeping the migration on track. This structured approach reduced risk and ensured both projects progressed smoothly.

- I prioritize based on impact, urgency, and dependencies, break tasks into milestones, delegate effectively, and communicate with stakeholders. This ensures high-priority work is completed on time without compromising quality.

#### 26. Tell me about a time when your manager set reasonable demands. Follow up: Describe a situation with unreasonable demands.

- In my previous role, my manager asked me to design a new microservice architecture for a migration project within a 3-month timeline. The expectation was clear, and the scope was realistic given the team size and resources.

I appreciated the clarity and structured approach. I planned the milestones, identified potential risks, and coordinated with the team to ensure smooth execution. We delivered the architecture on time, which validated the manager’s realistic planning and helped the team stay focused.

- In another situation, a manager asked me to implement a complex feature on a product with a tight 2-week deadline, which was not feasible given the testing and integration required. Instead of reacting negatively, I analyzed the requirements, identified the critical components that could be delivered safely, and proposed a phased approach.

I communicated this plan to the manager, showing the risks of rushing versus the benefits of a staged rollout. The manager agreed to the phased approach, and we were able to deliver the core functionality on time while ensuring quality. This experience taught me the importance of data-driven communication and proactive problem-solving when handling unrealistic demands.

#### 27. How do you manage multiple priorities? Do you prefer working in a dynamic environment with changing priorities or doing the same type of work repeatedly?

I manage multiple priorities by evaluating tasks based on impact, urgency, and dependencies. I break down work into milestones, set realistic timelines, and communicate proactively with stakeholders to align expectations. I also delegate when appropriate to ensure team productivity isn’t compromised. For example, when I was handling a system migration and a POC simultaneously, I created clear milestones, coordinated the team, and successfully delivered both projects on time.

Regarding the type of environment, I thrive in dynamic environments with changing priorities. I enjoy analyzing shifting requirements, adapting plans, and learning new technologies. At the same time, I value some level of routine for repetitive work to ensure efficiency and maintain quality. Balancing both keeps me engaged, productive, and continuously learning.

#### How do you handle situations where work assigned to you keeps getting de-prioritized and changed repeatedly? How would you feel about it?

I handle frequent reprioritization by focusing on adaptability and communication. When work is de-prioritized or requirements change, I first try to understand the reasoning behind it by discussing with stakeholders or the manager. This helps me align expectations and adjust my plan effectively.

I also reassess priorities and dependencies, updating timelines and keeping the team informed. For example, in a past project, a feature I was developing was repeatedly shifted due to changing product priorities. I used the opportunity to refactor related modules, improve test coverage, and help teammates with other high-priority tasks.

Personally, I remain calm and solution-focused. While it can be frustrating at first, I view it as a chance to learn, support the team, and improve processes. This approach ensures that I stay productive, maintain team trust, and contribute positively despite shifting priorities.

- When work is repeatedly de-prioritized, I focus on understanding the reasons, reassess priorities, adjust plans, and communicate with stakeholders. I stay calm and use the time to support the team or improve related work, turning shifting priorities into productive opportunities.
